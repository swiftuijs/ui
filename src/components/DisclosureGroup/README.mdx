# DisclosureGroup

## Overview

DisclosureGroup is a view that shows or hides its content based on a disclosure state. DisclosureGroup creates an expandable/collapsible section with a toggle control.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `DisclosureGroup`.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={DisclosureGroupStories.Default} />

## Default Expanded

<Canvas of={DisclosureGroupStories.DefaultExpanded} />

## Controlled Mode

<Canvas of={DisclosureGroupStories.Controlled} />

## Multiple Groups

<Canvas of={DisclosureGroupStories.MultipleGroups} />

## With Complex Content

<Canvas of={DisclosureGroupStories.WithComplexContent} />

## Notes

- DisclosureGroup requires a `label` prop
- DisclosureGroup supports controlled and uncontrolled modes
- Use `defaultExpanded` for uncontrolled mode
- Use `expanded` and `onExpandedChange` for controlled mode
- DisclosureGroup automatically handles expand/collapse animations

## Best Practices

1. **Clear labels**: Use descriptive labels that indicate what's inside
2. **Content organization**: Use DisclosureGroup to organize related content
3. **State management**: Choose controlled or uncontrolled mode based on your needs
4. **Accessibility**: DisclosureGroup includes proper ARIA attributes
5. **Performance**: DisclosureGroup only renders content when expanded
