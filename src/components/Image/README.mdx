# Image

## Overview

Image is a view that displays an image. Use Image to display images from various sources, including bundled images, system images, and images from URLs.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `Image`.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={ImageStories.Default} />

## With Alt Text

Always provide alt text for accessibility:

<Canvas of={ImageStories.WithAltText} />

## Custom Styling

Apply custom styles to images:

<Canvas of={ImageStories.WithCustomStyle} />

## In Layouts

### In HStack

<Canvas of={ImageStories.InHStack} />

### In VStack

<Canvas of={ImageStories.InVStack} />

### In ZStack

<Canvas of={ImageStories.InZStack} />

## Responsive Images

Make images responsive to container size:

<Canvas of={ImageStories.Responsive} />

## Multiple Images

<Canvas of={ImageStories.MultipleImages} />

## Notes

- Always provide `alt` text for accessibility
- Images support all standard HTML img attributes
- Use `style` prop for custom styling (borderRadius, border, etc.)
- For responsive images, use `maxWidth: '100%'` and `height: 'auto'`
- Images can be used in any layout component (HStack, VStack, ZStack, etc.)

## Best Practices

1. **Alt text**: Always provide descriptive alt text for screen readers
2. **Responsive**: Make images responsive for different screen sizes
3. **Loading**: Consider lazy loading for images below the fold
4. **Optimization**: Optimize image sizes for web performance
5. **Placeholders**: Use placeholders or loading states for async image loading
