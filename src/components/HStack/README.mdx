# HStack

## Overview

HStack is a view that arranges its children in a horizontal line. An HStack is a container view that arranges its child views in a horizontal line. You can customize the spacing between views and the alignment of views within the stack.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `HStack`.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={HStackStories.Default} />

## Spacing

Control the distance between child views:

<Canvas of={HStackStories.WithSpacing} />

## Alignment

Align children vertically within the HStack:

### Leading Alignment

<Canvas of={HStackStories.LeadingAlignment} />

### Center Alignment

<Canvas of={HStackStories.CenterAlignment} />

### Trailing Alignment

<Canvas of={HStackStories.TrailingAlignment} />

## With Spacer

Use Spacer to create flexible space:

<Canvas of={HStackStories.WithSpacer} />

## With Buttons

<Canvas of={HStackStories.WithButtons} />

## Complex Layout

<Canvas of={HStackStories.ComplexLayout} />

## Notes

- HStack arranges children horizontally from leading to trailing
- Default alignment is 'center'
- Spacing applies uniformly between all adjacent children
- HStack supports all standard React children (components, text, etc.)

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent spacing**: Use consistent spacing values throughout your app
2. **Alignment**: Choose appropriate alignment based on content type
3. **Nesting**: HStack can be nested with VStack and ZStack for complex layouts
4. **Performance**: For long lists, consider using LazyHStack instead
5. **Responsive**: HStack automatically adapts to container width and may wrap on smaller screens
