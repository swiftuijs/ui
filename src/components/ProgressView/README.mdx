# ProgressView

## Overview

ProgressView is a view that displays the progress of a task. ProgressView can show determinate progress (with a specific value) or indeterminate progress (spinning indicator).

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `ProgressView`.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={ProgressViewStories.Default} />

## Animated Progress

ProgressView can be animated to show progress changes:

<Canvas of={ProgressViewStories.Animated} />

## Notes

- ProgressView supports determinate progress (0-1 or completed/total)
- ProgressView supports indeterminate progress (spinning indicator)
- Progress value should be between 0 and 1
- ProgressView provides visual feedback for task progress
- Use ProgressView for file uploads, downloads, and other async operations

## Best Practices

1. **Value range**: Keep progress values between 0 and 1
2. **Feedback**: Update progress regularly for better UX
3. **Indeterminate**: Use indeterminate style when progress is unknown
4. **Placement**: Place ProgressView where users expect to see progress
5. **Accessibility**: Provide text labels indicating progress percentage
