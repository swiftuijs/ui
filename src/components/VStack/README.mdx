# VStack

## Overview

VStack is a view that arranges its children in a vertical line. A VStack is a container view that arranges its child views in a vertical line. You can customize the spacing between views and the alignment of views within the stack.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `VStack`.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={VStackStories.Default} />

## Spacing

Control the distance between child views:

<Canvas of={VStackStories.WithSpacing} />

## Alignment

Align children horizontally within the VStack:

### Leading Alignment

<Canvas of={VStackStories.WithAlignment} />

### Center Alignment

<Canvas of={VStackStories.CenterAligned} />

### Trailing Alignment

<Canvas of={VStackStories.TrailingAligned} />

## With Spacer

Use Spacer to create flexible space:

<Canvas of={VStackStories.WithSpacer} />

## With Buttons

<Canvas of={VStackStories.WithButtons} />

## Complex Layout

<Canvas of={VStackStories.ComplexLayout} />

## Notes

- VStack arranges children vertically from top to bottom
- Default alignment is based on container settings
- Spacing applies uniformly between all adjacent children
- VStack supports all standard React children (components, text, etc.)

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent spacing**: Use consistent spacing values throughout your app
2. **Alignment**: Choose appropriate alignment based on content type
3. **Nesting**: VStack can be nested with HStack and ZStack for complex layouts
4. **Performance**: For long lists, consider using LazyVStack instead
5. **Responsive**: VStack automatically adapts to container width
