# Sheet

## Overview

Sheet is a view that presents content as a modal sheet. Sheets slide up from the bottom of the screen and are commonly used for presenting forms, settings, or additional content.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `.sheet()` modifier.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={SheetStories.Default} />

## Form Sheet

Use form sheet style for forms and input:

<Canvas of={SheetStories.FormSheet} />

## Full Screen

Present content in full screen:

<Canvas of={SheetStories.FullScreen} />

## Notes

- Sheet requires `isPresented` and `onDismiss` props
- Sheet supports different presentation styles
- Sheet automatically handles dismiss gestures
- Use Sheet for modal presentations
- Sheet can contain any React content

## Best Practices

1. **Dismiss handling**: Always provide `onDismiss` handler
2. **Presentation style**: Choose appropriate style for your content
3. **Drag indicator**: Show drag indicator for better UX
4. **Content**: Keep sheet content focused and concise
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure sheet content is accessible and keyboard navigable
