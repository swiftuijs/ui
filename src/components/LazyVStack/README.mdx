# LazyVStack

## Overview

LazyVStack is a container that arranges its children vertically, loading them lazily. LazyVStack is similar to VStack but only renders children that are visible in the viewport, improving performance for long lists.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `LazyVStack`.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={LazyVStackStories.Default} />

## In ScrollView

<Canvas of={LazyVStackStories.InScrollView} />

## With Estimated Item Height

<Canvas of={LazyVStackStories.WithEstimatedHeight} />

## With Alignment

<Canvas of={LazyVStackStories.WithAlignment} />

## Notes

- LazyVStack supports all VStack props (spacing, alignment, etc.)
- LazyVStack only renders visible items for better performance
- Use `estimatedItemHeight` to optimize virtualization
- LazyVStack is ideal for long lists and scrollable content
- LazyVStack automatically handles viewport detection

## Best Practices

1. **Long lists**: Use LazyVStack for lists with many items
2. **Performance**: LazyVStack improves performance for large datasets
3. **Estimated height**: Provide estimatedItemHeight when possible
4. **Keys**: Always provide unique keys for list items
5. **ScrollView**: Use LazyVStack within ScrollView for scrollable lists
