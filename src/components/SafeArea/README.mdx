# SafeArea

## Overview

SafeArea is a view that insets its content to respect safe area boundaries. SafeArea ensures content is not obscured by system UI elements like notches, status bars, and home indicators.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `.safeAreaInset()` modifier.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={SafeAreaStories.Default} />

## Specific Edges

Apply safe area insets to specific edges:

<Canvas of={SafeAreaStories.TopOnly} />

## Notes

- SafeArea automatically adjusts for system UI elements
- SafeArea can be applied to all edges or specific edges
- SafeArea is essential for mobile devices with notches
- SafeArea ensures content is visible and accessible
- Use SafeArea at the root level of your app

## Best Practices

1. **Root level**: Apply SafeArea at the root of your app
2. **Specific edges**: Use specific edges when you only need certain safe areas
3. **Testing**: Test on devices with notches and system UI elements
4. **Content**: Ensure important content is within safe areas
5. **Consistency**: Use SafeArea consistently throughout your app
