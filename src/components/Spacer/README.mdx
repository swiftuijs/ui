# Spacer

## Overview

Spacer is a flexible space that expands along the major axis of its parent container. Spacer is used to push content apart and create flexible layouts.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `Spacer`.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={SpacerStories.Default} />

## In HStack

Use Spacer to push content to edges:

<Canvas of={SpacerStories.InHStack} />

## In VStack

<Canvas of={SpacerStories.InVStack} />

## With Minimum Length

Set a minimum length for the spacer:

<Canvas of={SpacerStories.WithMinLength} />

## Multiple Spacers

Use multiple spacers for complex layouts:

<Canvas of={SpacerStories.MultipleSpacers} />

## Leading Spacer

Push content to the trailing edge:

<Canvas of={SpacerStories.LeadingSpacer} />

## Trailing Spacer

Push content to the leading edge:

<Canvas of={SpacerStories.TrailingSpacer} />

## Complex Layout

<Canvas of={SpacerStories.ComplexLayout} />

## Notes

- Spacer expands to fill available space in its parent container
- Spacer works in both HStack (horizontal) and VStack (vertical) layouts
- Use `minLength` to set a minimum size for the spacer
- Multiple spacers divide available space equally
- Spacer requires a parent container with defined dimensions

## Best Practices

1. **Parent dimensions**: Ensure parent container has explicit dimensions for Spacer to work
2. **Multiple spacers**: Use multiple spacers to distribute space evenly
3. **Min length**: Set appropriate minimum lengths to prevent content from being too close
4. **Layout structure**: Use Spacer to create flexible, responsive layouts
5. **Performance**: Spacer is lightweight and doesn't impact performance
