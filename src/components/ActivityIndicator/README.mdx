# ActivityIndicator

## Overview

ActivityIndicator is a view that displays a spinning indicator to show that a task is in progress. ActivityIndicator is commonly used to indicate loading states.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `ProgressView` with indeterminate style.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={ActivityIndicatorStories.Default} />

## Notes

- ActivityIndicator displays an animated spinning indicator
- Use ActivityIndicator to show that a task is in progress
- ActivityIndicator supports different sizes (small, medium, large)
- Custom colors can be applied via the `color` prop
- ActivityIndicator is non-interactive and purely visual

## Best Practices

1. **Loading states**: Use ActivityIndicator to indicate async operations
2. **Placement**: Place ActivityIndicator where users expect to see content
3. **Size**: Choose appropriate size based on context
4. **Accessibility**: Provide text labels for screen readers
5. **Performance**: ActivityIndicator is lightweight and doesn't impact performance
