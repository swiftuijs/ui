# LazyHGrid

## Overview

LazyHGrid is a container that arranges its children in a horizontal grid, loading them lazily. LazyHGrid creates a horizontal grid layout with lazy loading for performance.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `LazyHGrid`.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={LazyHGridStories.Default} />

## Three Rows

<Canvas of={LazyHGridStories.ThreeRows} />

## Four Rows

<Canvas of={LazyHGridStories.FourRows} />

## With Images

<Canvas of={LazyHGridStories.WithImages} />

## Large Grid

<Canvas of={LazyHGridStories.LargeGrid} />

## Notes

- LazyHGrid requires a `rows` prop to specify the number of rows
- LazyHGrid supports `spacing` prop for item spacing
- LazyHGrid only renders visible items for better performance
- LazyHGrid is ideal for horizontal grid layouts with many items
- Default rows is 2 if not specified

## Best Practices

1. **Rows**: Choose appropriate number of rows for your layout
2. **Spacing**: Use consistent spacing between grid items
3. **Performance**: LazyHGrid improves performance for large grids
4. **Keys**: Always provide unique keys for grid items
5. **Responsive**: Consider responsive row counts for different screen sizes
