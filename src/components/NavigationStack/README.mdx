# NavigationStack

## Overview

NavigationStack is a container that manages a stack of views for navigation. NavigationStack provides navigation functionality similar to iOS navigation controllers, allowing users to navigate forward and backward through a hierarchy of views.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `NavigationStack`.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={NavigationStackStories.NavigationStackBetween} />

## Notes

- NavigationStack manages the navigation hierarchy
- Use NavigationLink to navigate between views
- NavigationStack automatically handles back navigation
- Pages can be StandardPage or custom components
- NavigationStack supports different page types (page, actionsheet)

## Best Practices

1. **Page structure**: Use StandardPage for consistent page layouts
2. **Navigation flow**: Design clear navigation flows that users can understand
3. **Back navigation**: Back navigation is handled automatically
4. **Deep linking**: Consider deep linking support for important views
5. **State management**: Manage navigation state appropriately for your app
