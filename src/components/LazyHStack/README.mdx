# LazyHStack

## Overview

LazyHStack is a container that arranges its children horizontally, loading them lazily. LazyHStack is similar to HStack but only renders children that are visible in the viewport, improving performance for long horizontal lists.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `LazyHStack`.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={LazyHStackStories.Default} />

## In ScrollView

<Canvas of={LazyHStackStories.InScrollView} />

## With Estimated Item Width

<Canvas of={LazyHStackStories.WithEstimatedWidth} />

## With Alignment

<Canvas of={LazyHStackStories.WithAlignment} />

## Notes

- LazyHStack supports all HStack props (spacing, alignment, etc.)
- LazyHStack only renders visible items for better performance
- Use `estimatedItemWidth` to optimize virtualization
- LazyHStack is ideal for long horizontal lists
- LazyHStack automatically handles viewport detection

## Best Practices

1. **Long lists**: Use LazyHStack for horizontal lists with many items
2. **Performance**: LazyHStack improves performance for large datasets
3. **Estimated width**: Provide estimatedItemWidth when possible
4. **Keys**: Always provide unique keys for list items
5. **ScrollView**: Use LazyHStack within ScrollView for scrollable horizontal lists
