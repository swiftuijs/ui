# TextEditor

## Overview

TextEditor is a view that displays and edits multiline text. TextEditor is used for longer text input that requires multiple lines, such as comments, descriptions, or messages.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `TextEditor`.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.Default} />

## With Min/Max Lines

Control the minimum and maximum number of lines:

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.WithMinMaxLines} />

## Disabled State

TextEditor can be disabled:

<Canvas of={TextEditorStories.Disabled} />

## Notes

- TextEditor supports controlled and uncontrolled modes
- Use `value` and `onChange` for controlled inputs
- `minLines` and `maxLines` control the editor height
- TextEditor automatically grows/shrinks within the line limits
- Use `placeholder` to provide hints about expected input

## Best Practices

1. **Line limits**: Set appropriate min/max lines for your use case
2. **Placeholders**: Provide clear placeholder text
3. **Validation**: Validate input length and content
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure TextEditor is accessible and keyboard navigable
5. **Mobile**: Test on mobile devices for proper keyboard behavior
