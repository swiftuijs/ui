# ZStack

## Overview

ZStack is a view that overlays its children, aligning them in both axes. A ZStack overlays child views on top of each other. You can control the alignment of the children within the ZStack.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `ZStack`.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={ZStackStories.Default} />

## Alignment

Control how children are aligned within the ZStack:

<Canvas of={ZStackStories.WithAlignment} />

### Top Leading

<Canvas of={ZStackStories.TopLeading} />

### Bottom Trailing

<Canvas of={ZStackStories.BottomTrailing} />

## Image Overlay

Common use case: overlay text on images:

<Canvas of={ZStackStories.ImageOverlay} />

## Button Overlay

<Canvas of={ZStackStories.ButtonOverlay} />

## Multiple Layers

ZStack can contain multiple layers:

<Canvas of={ZStackStories.MultipleLayers} />

## Notes

- Children are stacked in the order they appear (first child is bottom layer)
- ZStack requires explicit dimensions or will size to fit children
- Alignment controls positioning of all children as a group
- Useful for overlays, badges, and layered UI elements

## Best Practices

1. **Layer order**: Place background elements first, foreground elements last
2. **Dimensions**: Always provide explicit dimensions for ZStack containers
3. **Alignment**: Use appropriate alignment for your design needs
4. **Performance**: Avoid excessive nesting of ZStack components
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure overlays don't obscure important content
