# LazyVGrid

## Overview

LazyVGrid is a container that arranges its children in a grid, loading them lazily. LazyVGrid creates a vertical grid layout with lazy loading for performance.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `LazyVGrid`.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={LazyVGridStories.Default} />

## Two Columns

<Canvas of={LazyVGridStories.TwoColumns} />

## Four Columns

<Canvas of={LazyVGridStories.FourColumns} />

## With Images

<Canvas of={LazyVGridStories.WithImages} />

## Large Grid

<Canvas of={LazyVGridStories.LargeGrid} />

## Notes

- LazyVGrid requires a `columns` prop to specify the number of columns
- LazyVGrid supports `spacing` prop for item spacing
- LazyVGrid only renders visible items for better performance
- LazyVGrid is ideal for grid layouts with many items
- Default columns is 2 if not specified

## Best Practices

1. **Columns**: Choose appropriate number of columns for your layout
2. **Spacing**: Use consistent spacing between grid items
3. **Performance**: LazyVGrid improves performance for large grids
4. **Keys**: Always provide unique keys for grid items
5. **Responsive**: Consider responsive column counts for different screen sizes
