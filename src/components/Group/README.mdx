# Group

## Overview

Group is a container for grouping view content. Group is a transparent container that groups views together without adding visual styling. It's useful for applying modifiers to multiple views at once.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `Group`.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={GroupStories.Default} />

## With Modifiers

<Canvas of={GroupStories.WithModifiers} />

## Conditional Rendering

<Canvas of={GroupStories.ConditionalRendering} />

## Nested Groups

<Canvas of={GroupStories.NestedGroups} />

## With Buttons

<Canvas of={GroupStories.WithButtons} />

## Notes

- Group is a transparent container with no visual styling
- Group is useful for applying styles or modifiers to multiple views
- Group doesn't affect layout (children render normally)
- Use Group when you need to group views without visual changes
- Group is commonly used with conditional rendering

## Best Practices

1. **Grouping**: Use Group to logically group related views
2. **Modifiers**: Apply styles or modifiers to multiple views at once
3. **Conditional rendering**: Use Group with conditional rendering
4. **No layout impact**: Remember Group doesn't affect layout
5. **Semantic grouping**: Use Group for semantic organization
