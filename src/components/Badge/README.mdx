# Badge

## Overview

Badge is a view that displays a badge, typically used to show counts, status, or labels. Badges are commonly used in navigation items, buttons, and list items.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `badge()` modifier.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Default} />

## Variants

Badge supports different visual variants:

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Styles} />

## Notes

- Badge displays a small label or count
- Badge supports different variants (primary, success, warning, error)
- Badge can contain text or numbers
- Badge is commonly used with navigation items and buttons
- Custom styles can be applied via the `style` prop

## Best Practices

1. **Counts**: Use badges to display notification counts
2. **Status**: Use variant colors to indicate status
3. **Size**: Keep badge content concise
4. **Placement**: Place badges in consistent locations
5. **Accessibility**: Provide appropriate labels for screen readers
