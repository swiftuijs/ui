# Section

## Overview

Section is a container view that groups related content. Sections are commonly used in Lists to organize items into logical groups with optional headers.

**SwiftUI Correspondence**: Similar to SwiftUI's `Section`.

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={SectionStories.Default} />

## With Header

Add a header to the section:

<Canvas of={SectionStories.WithHeader} />

## Multiple Sections

Use multiple sections to organize content:

<Canvas of={SectionStories.MultipleSections} />

## With Buttons

Sections can contain interactive elements:

<Canvas of={SectionStories.WithButtons} />

## Complex Content

<Canvas of={SectionStories.ComplexContent} />

## Custom Styling

Apply custom styles to Section:

<Canvas of={SectionStories.CustomStyle} />

## Notes

- Sections are commonly used within List components
- Headers are optional but recommended for better organization
- Sections support all standard React children
- Use sections to group related content logically
- Sections can be nested, though it's not common

## Best Practices

1. **Clear headers**: Use descriptive headers that clearly indicate section content
2. **Logical grouping**: Group related items together in sections
3. **Consistent styling**: Maintain consistent section styling throughout your app
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure section headers are properly marked up for screen readers
5. **Spacing**: Use appropriate spacing between sections for visual clarity
